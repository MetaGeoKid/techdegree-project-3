Phrase Hunter Game


In this game, the user will be prompted to guess a letter in a randomly generated phrase. Each time a letter is guessed, the user will be told if the guess was in the phrase or not. If the letter was in the phrase, then the location of the letter will be revealed. If not, the user will lose one of their five lives. 


The user wins if they guess all the letters in the phrase before losing their five lives. Good luck!
